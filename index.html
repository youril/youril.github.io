	<h2>look i'm saying h1 is the most important, it's really not about size of stuff</h2>
	<h6>yay</h6>
	<p id="para1">this is crazy because i used to do <em>this</em> for fun lololol
	this is a block level element so nothing can go to the right side of it or nothing can go to the right side?? CONTRAST with inline like em you can have stuff to the left and to the right of it. you can override this stuff later with CSS</p>
	<p>front end web dev VS back end
	front - stuff user interacts with (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
		HTML - describe semantics of a document? mark up language
		CSS - style your text document
		JavaScript - behavior of your website
	back - database, like where you save someone's information</p>

		<p>what if you want input from user? so then you're building a form. # in form is like there's no where to submit it yet, 'get' is getting info from somewhere, 'post' is posting the info from somewhere. so label for= is referring to the id. if you do type=password then it does the cool bullets.</p>
		<p>so then we need to make a button to submit this form. oh ps it doesn't matter what order the attributes are. great website called stackoverflow look it up</p>
		<form action="#" method="post">
			<label for="username">Username</label>
			<input id="username" name="username" type="text"/>
			<br/>
			<label for"password">Password</label>
			<input id="password" name="password" type="password"/>
			<input type="submit" value="Log In"/>
		</form>
